# Blogs classification, predicting the age range of the authors

#### Project description :

Build classifiers to predict the age range of blogs' authors, amongst 3 classes, namely: "10-19 years", "20-29 years" and "30+ years".  
An important part of our study was focused towards the pre-processing of the blogs: analyzing the disparity of the distribution of words amongst the three classes, the best compromise between a larger vocabulary size and a smaller training time, etc.  
Three models were built: a customed Naïve Bayes, a Random Forest, and a Logistic Regression. Their accuracies is compared in the report.
